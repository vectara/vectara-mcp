## Configuration with Claude Desktop

Add to your claude_desktop_config.json:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Vectara": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "tool",
        "run",
        "vectara-mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage in Claude Desktop App

Once the installation is complete, and the Claude desktop app is configured, you must completely close and re-open the Claude desktop app to see the Vectara-mcp server. You should see a hammer icon in the bottom left of the app, indicating available MCP tools, you can click on the hammer icon to see more detial on the Vectara-search and Vectara-extract tools.

Now claude will have complete access to the Vectara-mcp server, including the ask-vectara and search-vectara tools. 
When you issue the tools for the first time, Claude will ask you for your Vectara api key and corpus key (or keys if you want to use multiple corpora). After you set those, you will be ready to go. Here are some examples you can try (with the Vectara corpus that includes information from our [website](https://vectara.com):

### Vectara RAG Examples

1. **Querying Vectara corpus**:
```
ask-vectara Who is Amr Awadallah?
```

2. **Searching Vectara corpus**:
```
search-vectara events in NYC?
```
