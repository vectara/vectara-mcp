The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables AI systems to interact seamlessly with various data sources and tools, facilitating secure, two-way connections.

Vectara-MCP provides any agentic application with access to fast, reliable RAG with reduced hallucination, powered by Vectara's Trusted RAG platform, through the MCP protocol.

## Installation

You can install the package directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install vectara-mcp
```

## Quick Start

### Secure by Default (HTTP/SSE with Authentication)

```bash
# Start server with secure HTTP transport (DEFAULT)
python -m vectara_mcp
# Server running at http://127.0.0.1:8000 with authentication enabled
```

### Local Development Mode (STDIO)

```bash
# For Claude Desktop or local development (less secure)
python -m vectara_mcp --stdio
# ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: STDIO transport is less secure. Use only for local development.
```

### Configuration Options

```bash
# Custom host and port
python -m vectara_mcp --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080

# SSE transport mode
python -m vectara_mcp --transport sse --path /sse

# Disable authentication (DANGEROUS - dev only)
python -m vectara_mcp --no-auth
```

## Transport Modes

### HTTP Transport (Default - Recommended)
- **Security:** Built-in authentication via bearer tokens
- **Encryption:** HTTPS ready
- **Rate Limiting:** 100 requests/minute by default
- **CORS Protection:** Configurable origin validation
- **Use Case:** Production deployments, cloud environments

### SSE Transport
- **Streaming:** Server-Sent Events for real-time updates
- **Authentication:** Bearer token support
- **Compatibility:** Works with legacy MCP clients
- **Use Case:** Real-time streaming applications

### STDIO Transport
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Security Warning:** No transport-layer security
- **Performance:** Low latency for local communication
- **Use Case:** Local development, Claude Desktop
- **Requirement:** Must be explicitly enabled with `--stdio` flag

## Environment Variables

```bash
# Required
export VECTARA_API_KEY="your-api-key"

# Optional
export VECTARA_AUTHORIZED_TOKENS="token1,token2"  # Additional auth tokens
export VECTARA_ALLOWED_ORIGINS="http://localhost:*,https://app.example.com"
export VECTARA_TRANSPORT="http"  # Default transport mode
export VECTARA_AUTH_REQUIRED="true"  # Enforce authentication
```

## Authentication

### HTTP/SSE Transport
When using HTTP or SSE transport, authentication is required by default:

```bash
# Using curl with bearer token
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $VECTARA_API_KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -X POST http://localhost:8000/call/ask_vectara \
     -d '{"query": "What is Vectara?", "corpus_keys": ["my-corpus"]}'

# Using X-API-Key header (alternative)
curl -H "X-API-Key: $VECTARA_API_KEY" \
     http://localhost:8000/sse
```

### Disabling Authentication (Development Only)
```bash
# ‚ö†Ô∏è NEVER use in production
python -m vectara_mcp --no-auth
```

## Configuration with Claude Desktop

To use with Claude Desktop, update your configuration to use STDIO transport:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Vectara": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "vectara_mcp", "--stdio"],
      "env": {
        "VECTARA_API_KEY": "your-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Or using uv:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Vectara": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["tool", "run", "vectara-mcp", "--stdio"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Note:** Claude Desktop requires STDIO transport. While less secure than HTTP, it's acceptable for local desktop use.

## Usage in Claude Desktop App

Once the installation is complete, and the Claude desktop app is configured, you must completely close and re-open the Claude desktop app to see the Vectara-mcp server. You should see a hammer icon in the bottom left of the app, indicating available MCP tools, you can click on the hammer icon to see more detail on the Vectara-search and Vectara-extract tools.

Now claude will have complete access to the Vectara-mcp server, including all six Vectara tools.

## Secure Setup Workflow

**First-time setup (one-time per session):**
1. Configure your API key securely:
```
setup-vectara-api-key
API key: [your-vectara-api-key]
```


**After setup, use any tools without exposing your API key:**

### Vectara Tool Examples

1. **RAG Query with Generation**:
```
ask-vectara
Query: Who is Amr Awadallah?
Corpus keys: ["your-corpus-key"]
```

2. **Semantic Search Only**:
```
search-vectara
Query: events in NYC?
Corpus keys: ["your-corpus-key"]
```

3. **Hallucination Detection & Correction**:
```
correct-hallucinations
Generated text: [text to check]
Documents: ["source1", "source2"]
```

4. **Factual Consistency Evaluation**:
```
eval-factual-consistency
Generated text: [text to evaluate]
Documents: ["reference1", "reference2"]
```

## Security Best Practices

1. **Always use HTTP transport for production** - Never expose STDIO transport to the network
2. **Keep authentication enabled** - Only disable with `--no-auth` for local testing
3. **Use HTTPS in production** - Deploy behind a reverse proxy with TLS termination
4. **Configure CORS properly** - Set `VECTARA_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` to restrict access
5. **Rotate API keys regularly** - Update `VECTARA_API_KEY` and `VECTARA_AUTHORIZED_TOKENS`
6. **Monitor rate limits** - Default 100 req/min, adjust based on your needs
